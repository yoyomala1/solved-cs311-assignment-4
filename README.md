Upgrade the simulator to a pipelined core model.

<ul>

 <li>Update your simulate function to a loop that looks something like this:</li>

</ul>

while ( not end of          simulation )

{ performRW performMA performEX performOF performIF

increment        clock by 1

}

Each stage must operate on the output generated by the previous stage in the <em>previous </em>cycle. If the input latch to the stage has invalid content (e.g., in the very first cycle, MA-RW latch has invalid content), the stage must do nothing.

<ul>

 <li>Implement data interlocks and control interlocks.</li>

</ul>
